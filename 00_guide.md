## 📚 Learning Materials Structure

Each module contains two complementary files:
- **📓 Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**: Interactive coding exercises, visualizations, and hands-on practice
- **📖 Markdown Guide (.md)**: Mathematical derivations, conceptual explanations, tutor instructions, and assessment checklists

This dual approach ensures both theoretical understanding and practical skills.

## 🎓 How to Use This Tutorial

### Recommended Learning Path
1. **Start with Foundations**: Phase 01 is crucial — don't skip the mathematical groundwork
2. **Follow Sequential Order**: Each module builds on previous concepts
3. **Use Both Materials**: Read the .md file for theory, then practice with the .ipynb notebook
4. **Complete Checkpoints**: Use checkpoint modules to assess and consolidate learning
5. **Practice Regularly**: Implement concepts with your own datasets and problems

### Study Strategy
- **Theory First**: Read the Markdown guide to understand concepts and mathematical foundations
- **Practice Second**: Work through the interactive notebook for a hands-on experience
- **Cross-Reference**: Use both files together—theory informs practice, practice reinforces theory
- **Self-Assessment**: Complete quizzes and checklists to verify understanding
- **Review Regularly**: Revisit earlier modules as you progress through advanced topics

### Time Investment
- **Phase 01 (Foundations)**: 2–3 weeks of dedicated study
- **Phase 02 (Classical ML)**: 3–4 weeks
- **Phase 03 (Deep Learning)**: 4–5 weeks
- **Phase 04 (Modern ML)**: 3–4 weeks
- **Phase 05 (Capstone)**: 2–3 weeks
- **Total**: 3–4 months of consistent, dedicated learning
