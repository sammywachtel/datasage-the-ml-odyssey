# Machine Learning Refresher: Roadmap & Usage Guide

## 📁 Structure

Each folder is a phase, and each subfolder is a specific topic. For every topic you’ll find:
- A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with hands-on code and quizzes
- A Markdown file (.md) with explanations, tutor prompts, derivations, and summary checklists

## 🎓 How to Use

- Work through the notebooks in order
- Review the Markdown before and after coding
- Use the tutor instructions for pop quizzes and concept refreshers
- Track your progress with the checklist at the bottom of each .md file

## 🔄 Revisiting Earlier Material

Each topic builds on earlier concepts. Don’t hesitate to jump back. That's part of the process.

Happy learning! You’re going to crush this. 🚀
