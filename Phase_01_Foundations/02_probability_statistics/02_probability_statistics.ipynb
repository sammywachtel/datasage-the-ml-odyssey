    "1. **What does the area under a probability density function represent?**\n",
    "   > The total probability = 1. For any specific interval, the area represents the probability of the random variable falling in that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How is a Binomial distribution different from a Normal distribution?**\n",
    "   > Binomial is discrete (countable outcomes like coin flips), while Normal is continuous (infinite possible values). Binomial models success/failure trials, Normal models bell-shaped continuous phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why does Bayes' Theorem require a denominator P(B)?**\n",
    "   > To normalize the probabilities so they sum to 1. It ensures we're calculating a proper conditional probability.\n",
    "\n",
