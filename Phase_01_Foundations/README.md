# Phase 01: Foundations

Welcome to the foundational phase of your machine learning journey! This phase builds the mathematical and programming groundwork essential for understanding modern ML algorithms.

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Overview

This phase covers the core mathematical concepts that underpin machine learning:
- **Linear Algebra**: Vectors, matrices, and transformations
- **Probability & Statistics**: Uncertainty, distributions, and Bayesian reasoning
- **Calculus**: Derivatives, gradients, and optimization
- **Python Tooling**: Essential libraries and development practices
- **Checkpoint Review**: Consolidation and assessment

## ðŸ“š Learning Path

Each module contains both theoretical foundations (`.md` files) and hands-on practice (`.ipynb` notebooks):

### 01. Linear Algebra Introduction
- **Theory**: [01_linear_algebra_intro.md](01_linear_algebra_intro/01_linear_algebra_intro.md)
- **Practice**: [01_linear_algebra_intro.ipynb](01_linear_algebra_intro/01_linear_algebra_intro.ipynb)
- **Focus**: Vectors, matrices, dot products, transformations

### 02. Probability & Statistics
- **Theory**: [02_probability_statistics.md](02_probability_statistics/02_probability_statistics.md)
- **Practice**: [02_probability_statistics.ipynb](02_probability_statistics/02_probability_statistics.ipynb)
- **Focus**: Distributions, Bayes' theorem, statistical inference

### 03. Calculus for Machine Learning
- **Theory**: [03_calculus_for_ml.md](03_calculus_for_ml/03_calculus_for_ml.md)
- **Practice**: [03_calculus_for_ml.ipynb](03_calculus_for_ml/03_calculus_for_ml.ipynb)
- **Focus**: Derivatives, gradients, optimization, chain rule

### 04. Python Tooling
- **Theory**: [04_python_tooling.md](04_python_tooling/04_python_tooling.md)
- **Practice**: [04_python_tooling.ipynb](04_python_tooling/04_python_tooling.ipynb)
- **Focus**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter workflows

### 05. Checkpoint 1 Review
- **Theory**: [05_checkpoint1_review.md](05_checkpoint1_review/05_checkpoint1_review.md)
- **Practice**: [05_checkpoint1_review.ipynb](05_checkpoint1_review/05_checkpoint1_review.ipynb)
- **Focus**: Integration and assessment of all foundation concepts

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Strategy

1. **Start with Theory**: Read the `.md` file to understand concepts and mathematical foundations
2. **Practice with Code**: Work through the `.ipynb` notebook for hands-on experience
3. **Cross-Reference**: Use both files together - theory informs practice, practice reinforces theory
4. **Check Understanding**: Complete quizzes and checklists in each module
5. **Review Regularly**: Revisit earlier modules as you progress through later ones

## âœ… Phase Completion Criteria

By the end of this phase, you should be able to:
- [ ] Perform vector and matrix operations confidently
- [ ] Understand and apply probability concepts to ML problems
- [ ] Compute derivatives and understand gradient-based optimization
- [ ] Use Python tools effectively for data manipulation and visualization
- [ ] Explain how these mathematical concepts connect to machine learning

## ðŸ”— What's Next?

After completing Phase 01, you'll be ready for **Phase 02: Classical Machine Learning**, where you'll apply these foundations to build your first ML models.

*ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Don't rush through this phase. A solid mathematical foundation will make all subsequent learning much easier and more intuitive.*
