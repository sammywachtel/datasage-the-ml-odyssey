# 01: Linear Algebra Intro

## üìò Overview
This file provides a conceptual and instructional guide for the AI tutor and student. It complements the Jupyter notebook with analogies, mathematical insights, and quizzing strategies.

## üß† Key Concepts
- **Vectors**: Quantities with direction and magnitude. Think of them like arrows in space.
- **Matrices**: Grids of numbers that can transform space. Imagine them as functions that stretch, rotate, reflect, or squash vectors.
- **Dot Product**: Measures alignment between two vectors. It is maximum when vectors point in the same direction.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Combines transformations. Order matters ($AB \ne BA$).

## üîç Mathematical Derivations

### Dot Product
Given vectors **a** and **b**:

$$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|a\| \|b\| \cos(\theta)
$$

This equals the projection of one vector onto the other when $\theta$ is the angle between them.

### Matrix Multiplication
If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix and $B$ is an $n \times p$ matrix, then:

$$
C = AB \quad \text{is an } m \times p \text{ matrix}
$$

## üé® Analogies & Intuition
- **Dot Product**: Like comparing how much two people are walking in the same direction.
- **Matrix as Transformation**: Picture gridlines bending, stretching, or rotating after a matrix is applied.
- **Identity Matrix**: Like multiplying by 1; it does nothing.
- **Zero Matrix**: Like muting all output.

## üéØ Tutor Instructions

### Teaching Prompts
- Ask the student: ‚ÄúIf the dot product is zero, what can we say about the angle between the vectors?‚Äù
- Have the student sketch a 2D vector and visualize what happens when you apply a matrix that doubles x-values and halves y-values.
- Encourage drawing: ‚ÄúShow me what a rotation matrix does to this square.‚Äù

### Pop Quiz Strategy
- Interleave memory questions from later topics (e.g., ‚ÄúCan you see how the dot product comes back in neural networks?‚Äù).
- Use ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù questions: ‚ÄúWhat if the transformation matrix is all zeros?‚Äù
